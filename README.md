# Upgrade Siren

> **No source, no upgrade.**

Upgrade Siren is a public upgrade-risk alarm for named Ethereum contracts. It resolves a protocol's ENS contract map, detects proxy implementation changes, compares old and new implementations with Sourcify data, and turns the result into a clear verdict for DAO voters, investors, wallets, and venture launch reviewers.

Built at **ETHPrague 2026** for *Building Ethereum's Solarpunk Future*.

## Why This Exists

Upgradeable contracts are one of Ethereum's quietest trust assumptions. A protocol can look stable, audited, and widely used, while the implementation behind its proxy changes underneath users. Most people do not read storage layouts, ABI diffs, admin rights, proxy slots, timelocks, or unverified bytecode before voting for an upgrade or funding an onchain venture.

Upgrade Siren makes that moment visible.

The product answers one question:

> Should this named protocol upgrade be trusted, reviewed, or rejected?

It is not a generic audit tool. It is not an AI scanner. It is an alarm for the exact moment when an implementation changes.

## Core Verdicts

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `SAFE` | New implementation is verified, upgrade path is expected, no high-risk structural changes detected |
| `REVIEW` | Upgrade may be legitimate, but contains changes that require human review |
| `SIREN` | Do not approve or fund until the risk is resolved |

## What We Are Building

1. **ENS Contract Map**
   - Resolve protocol-owned names such as `vault.demo.upgradesiren.eth`
   - Read stable `upgrade-siren:*` records for chain, proxy, owner, and schema
   - Read one atomic `upgrade-siren:upgrade_manifest` for current upgrade state, report pointer, report hash, and version history
   - ENS is the identity and version surface, not decoration

2. **Proxy Upgrade Detector**
   - Read EIP-1967 implementation slots
   - Detect `Upgraded(address)` events
   - Compare current implementation against the signed ENS manifest when available
   - Fall back to lower-confidence public-read mode for protocols without Upgrade Siren records
   - Surface owner/admin/timelock status when available

3. **Sourcify Evidence Engine**
   - Fetch verification status, source metadata, ABI, compiler metadata, and storage layout
   - Compare old vs. new implementations
   - Flag unverified implementations, added privileged selectors, removed safety functions, storage-layout hazards, and risky delegatecall/external-call patterns

4. **Siren Report**
   - Human verdict first
   - Evidence drawer for technical judges
   - Governance-ready comment generator
   - EIP-712 signed report bound to `upgrade-siren:owner` for production trust

5. **Siren Agent**
   - A monitoring agent that watches a contract or venture watchlist
   - Runs analysis when implementation, ENS records, or verification state changes
   - Produces signed risk reports for DAO voters, wallets, investors, and venture launch reviewers

## Sponsor Strategy

| Priority | Target | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Sourcify Bounty** | Sourcify data is the core evidence source: verified source, ABI, compiler metadata, storage layouts, bytecode, similarity search |
| 2 | **ENS Most Creative Use** | ENS provides contract identity, version naming, report discovery, and live resolution |
| 3 | **ETHPrague Future Society** | Public-good safety tooling for users, DAO voters, and onchain communities |
| Optional | **Umia Best Agentic Venture** | Only if framed as Siren Agent: a due-diligence and post-launch monitoring agent for tokenized onchain ventures |

We do **not** submit Swarm, SpaceComputer, or Apify unless Daniel explicitly swaps the strategy. Swarm can be a future report-storage integration, but it is not core to the current product.

## What This Is Not

- Not Agent Float
- Not a generic smart contract scanner
- Not an AI auditor
- Not a token launchpad
- Not an agent marketplace
- Not an ENS profile page
- Not a replacement for audits
- Not a claim that verified equals safe

## Demo Flow

The five-minute demo has three prepared upgrades plus one live public-read protocol:

1. **Safe upgrade**
   - Both implementations verified
   - Storage layout compatible
   - No new privileged selectors
   - Verdict: `SAFE`

2. **Dangerous upgrade**
   - New implementation verified
   - Adds `sweep(address token, address to)` and changes storage layout
   - Verdict: `SIREN`

3. **Unverified upgrade**
   - Proxy points to implementation not verified on Sourcify
   - ENS manifest and live slot disagree
   - Verdict: `SIREN`

4. **Live public-read protocol**
   - Existing mainnet protocol without Upgrade Siren records
   - Uses public chain state + Sourcify only
   - Verdict: `REVIEW` or `SIREN`, never `SAFE`

Five-second moment:

> A protocol name resolves through ENS, a proxy implementation changes, and the screen turns from green to red: **No source, no upgrade.**

## Current Status

**Live demo:** https://upgrade-siren.vercel.app

Scope locked 2026-05-09. Backlog `docs/13-backlog.md` generated, dev pipeline executed across three streams plus a Release Manager. As of this commit:

- **Stream A (Contract Fixtures):** 13/13 merged. Fixtures deployed and Sourcify-verified on Sepolia (chain 11155111). ENS parent `upgrade-siren-demo.eth` registered, four demo subnames provisioned (`vault` / `safe` / `dangerous` / `unverified`), three signed Siren Reports hosted with EIP-712 signatures recovering to `upgrade-siren:owner`.
- **Stream B (Evidence Engine):** 23/23 merged. Verdict engine (SAFE / REVIEW / SIREN) with deterministic findings, ENS resolver, EIP-1967 slot reader, Sourcify v2 fetch, ABI / storage diff, manifest parser with hash-chain validation, EIP-712 verification.
- **Stream C (Web UX):** scaffold + verdict card + evidence drawer + ABI/storage diff renderers + governance comment generator + demo runner all merged. Live `/r/[name]` orchestration page is the next P0 (US-068) — current implementation reads fixture data; full live data pipeline is in progress.
- **Tracker:** US-060 custody decision merged. US-061 mainnet ENS parent descoped to P1 / post-hack (Sepolia parent suffices for demo).
